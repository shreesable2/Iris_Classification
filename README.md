# Iris_Classification
This is a machine learning project that classifies the species of iris flowers based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about iris flowers from three different species - Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. The dataset has 150 observations with 5 features, including the target variable (species).

Methodology
We have used a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers. We have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and preprocess the data for model training. We have used the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to build the classification model.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Results
We have evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy score. The final model has an accuracy score of 0.96, which indicates that the model can classify the species of iris flowers accurately.

Usage
To use the model, you can input the features of the iris flower (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) into the trained model, and it will predict the species of the iris flower based on the input.
